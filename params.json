The Tissue Banks & Pathology Tools (TBPT) Workspace has put in place program elements to support this vision:\r\n\r\nDeveloping Software Tools (for example, caTissue Suite) that address the unmet needs of the community\r\nFostering of a collaborative culture through data sharing\r\nEngaging the research and vendor communities to demonstrate interoperability.\r\n\r\n## Overview:\r\n\r\n***\r\nFinding and accessing biospecimens and associated data today is a disintegrated experience. Each institution has its specific biorepository management solution. Basic information about specimen collections is rarely shared or easily searchable. The goal for a Common Biorepository Model (CBM) is to reduce the time and effort required by researchers to locate a biobank that has the specimens they need. The CBM does not seek a full data exchange but to selectively share key information to enable a single search across multiple biobanks. The idea behind a CBM builds on the success of the caBIG® effort and makes it easier for repositories to share data on the caGrid. A CBM supports the idea that data should fit a standardized simple domain model as a means to promote sharing. A CBM would define the infrastructure to enable a dynamically updated repository that can be queried as a service. As data is exchanged using CBM, the documentation and quality of biomaterials should by proxy improve. Finally, maintaining a minimal model would support personally identifiable information (PII) compliance. The result is an evolving searchable catalog of basic specimen information that is simple, mutually understood, and community supported.\r\n\r\n![](https://tcrnpm.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/30670884/CBM1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1394373732482&api=v2)\r\n\r\nTo provide caBIG®-compatible solutions, the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) is working alongside the vendor community to establish a Common Biorepository Model (CBM) as a way for biorepositories to advertise their holdings to the research community. The CBM will work as a federated back-end database to support query tools, such as the Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research’s Specimen Resource Locator (SRL).\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.

The Researcher now has a finite list where they can directly call and find additional information about the specimens available and how to gain access to them or associated data about them.\r\n\r\n**## CBM Challenge: Enabling Biospecimen Data Sharing**\r\n\r\n***\r\nThe CBM Data-Sharing Challenge was issued in June 2009, with the goal of researchers successfully receiving samples identified with the help of the CBM by the end of 2011. In the first phase, the NCI will release a model which has successfully passed the caBIG® compatibility review along with a test suite. In the second phase, vendors will implement the model into their specimen management solutions. The third phase is marked by cancer centers exposing data onto caGrid via vendors’/caTissue Suite CBM offerings. Once the data is available, the Challenge is completed when researchers are able to receive specimens that they have located through a locator tool which uses the CBM as a back-end data base.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
